## 🎨 How to Use

### Basic Drawing
1. **Select a color** from the palette in the toolbar
2. **Choose a drawing tool** (pen, brush, marker)
3. **Click and drag** on the canvas to draw
4. **Use undo/redo** buttons to manage your drawing history

### Store Comparison
1. **Draw something** on the canvas
2. **Switch stores** using the dropdown in the toolbar
3. **Notice** how your drawing persists across different state managers
4. **Open the State Debugger** to inspect internal state differences

### State Debugging
1. **Expand debugger sections** to view different parts of the state
2. **Copy JSON** to clipboard for external analysis
3. **Watch real-time updates** as you draw and interact
4. **Compare state structures** between different store implementations

## 🔍 State Management Implementations

### 1. Zustand Implementation

**File**: `src/store/zustandStore.ts`

```typescript
// Lightweight store with Immer middleware
const useCanvasStore = create<CanvasStore>()(
  immer((set) => ({
    // State
    shapes: [],
    currentColor: '#000000',
    
    // Actions  
    startDrawing: (point) => set((state) => {
      state.isDrawing = true
      state.currentPath = [point]
    })
  }))
)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Minimal boilerplate code
- ✅ Excellent TypeScript integration
- ✅ Built-in performance optimizations
- ✅ Simple, intuitive API

**Cons:**
- ❌ Smaller ecosystem compared to Redux
- ❌ Less tooling support
- ❌ Newer library with evolving patterns

### 2. Redux Toolkit Implementation

**File**: `src/store/reduxStore.ts`

```typescript
// Modern Redux with createSlice
const canvasSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'canvas',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    startDrawing: (state, action) => {
      state.isDrawing = true
      state.currentPath = [action.payload]
    }
  }
})
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Mature ecosystem with extensive tooling
- ✅ Excellent debugging with Redux DevTools
- ✅ Predictable state updates
- ✅ Great for large, complex applications

**Cons:**
- ❌ More boilerplate than other solutions
- ❌ Steeper learning curve
- ❌ Requires additional setup

### 3. React Context API Implementation

**File**: `src/store/contextStore.tsx`

```typescript
// Built-in React state management
const canvasReducer = (state: CanvasState, action: CanvasAction) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'START_DRAWING':
      return {
        ...state,
        isDrawing: true,
        currentPath: [action.payload]
      }
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ No additional dependencies
- ✅ Built into React core
- ✅ Perfect for component-tree state
- ✅ Simple mental model

**Cons:**
- ❌ Can cause unnecessary re-renders
- ❌ Verbose for complex state logic
- ❌ Limited debugging tools

## 🔄 Universal Store Adapter

The **Universal Store Adapter** (`src/hooks/storeAdapter.ts`) provides a unified interface across all three state management solutions:

```typescript
// Same interface for all stores
const canvasStore = useCanvasStore()

// Works with Zustand, Redux, or Context
canvasStore.startDrawing(point)
canvasStore.setColor('#ff0000')
canvasStore.undo()
```

This abstraction allows:
- **Runtime store switching** without changing component code
- **Fair performance comparisons** between implementations
- **Consistent developer experience** across different approaches
- **Easy migration** between state management solutions

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### Bundle Size Impact
- **Zustand**: +2.8KB gzipped
- **Redux Toolkit**: +12.4KB gzipped  
- **Context API**: +0KB (built into React)

### Runtime Performance
- **Zustand**: Fastest updates, minimal re-renders
- **Redux Toolkit**: Good performance with proper memoization
- **Context API**: Can be slower with frequent updates

### Developer Experience
- **Zustand**: Fastest to implement, least boilerplate
- **Redux Toolkit**: Best tooling, most predictable
- **Context API**: Familiar to React developers, most verbose

## 🧪 Testing Store Implementations

You can verify each implementation works correctly by:

1. **Drawing complex shapes** with multiple colors
2. **Switching between stores** mid-drawing
3. **Using undo/redo extensively** 
4. **Inspecting state** with the debugger
5. **Testing on mobile devices** for touch support

## 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

1. **Implementation Patterns** - How to structure each state management approach
2. **Performance Trade-offs** - Real-world performance characteristics
3. **Developer Experience** - Boilerplate, typing, and debugging differences
4. **Migration Strategies** - How to abstract state management for easier switching
5. **Real-world Usage** - Canvas drawing provides complex state scenarios
